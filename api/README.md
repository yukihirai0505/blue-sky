## Run application

To run application, call:
```
sbt run
```
If you wanna restart your application without reloading of sbt, use:
```
sbt re-start
```

### Run in Docker

For launching application in Docker, you must configure database docker instance and run docker image, generated by sbt.

Generating application docker image and publishing on localhost:
```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

Example of running, generated docker image:
```
docker run --name restapi -e DB_USER=dbuser -e DB_PASSWORD=dbpass -e DB_NAME=dbname -d --link DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME:database -p 9090:9000 APPLICATION_IMAGE
```

- `DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME` - name of your Postgresql docker instance
- `APPLICATION_IMAGE` - id or name of application docker image

## Run tests

To run tests, call:
```
sbt test
```
